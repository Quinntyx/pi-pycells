# Output handling and the code view

## What it does

When the model runs a Python cell through `exec_cell`, the extension decides what the model sees, what the user sees, and what survives on disk. The raw cell output is never sent to the model in full: it is composed into host-owned sections (`output:`, `return (Out[n]):`, `kernel:`, `subagents:`), and anything larger than a configured character budget is collapsed into a head/tail preview that points at the `read_cell_output` tool, which pages through the full output persisted in the notebook. On the user's side, call arguments, running cells, and finished cells share line-numbered `In[N]:` / `Out[N]:` boxes. The pending input preview is replaced by the result, never duplicated. Labels have a one-column transcript inset and a shared three-digit gutter. The host tool-call background covers the entire box, including labels, borders, content, and padding. `request_cell_review` shows a separate Shiki-highlighted preview without executing code. Python tracebacks get at most one appended, deterministic `help:` hint.

## How it works

### Sectioned output (model-visible result)

The host — not the cell — composes the result. Section markers (`output`, `return`, `kernel`, `subagents`) sit at column 0 and every line the cell produced is indented two spaces underneath them, so provenance is structural: a cell that prints `kernel:` lands inside the `output:` section and cannot impersonate a real marker (`sectionize`, `parseSectionedOutput` in `src/utils.ts`; `buildFinalOutput` in `src/python-session-manager.ts`).

- `output:` — everything the cell printed to stdout.
- `return (Out[n]):` — the echoed last bare expression, Jupyter `Out[n]` semantics. The header carries the cell number, so it also identifies the cell index for `read_cell_output`.
- `kernel:` — namespace summary (imports/functions/vars) from the runtime.
- `subagents:` — pool progress, only when the cell spawned `pi_subagents` pools.

The cell renderer parses the same sections with `parseSectionedOutput`, displaying printed output and the expression result together in the Out box without repeating host metadata headings. Plain tracebacks or unsectioned error text render verbatim inside that box, subject to the same viewport rules. Preamble lines before the first marker are dropped from the parsed view (the host normally emits marker-first output).

### Head/tail preview collapsing

`collapseOutputPreview` (`src/utils.ts`) caps the model-visible result at `settings.outputPreviewChars` (default 12,000, from `PTC_OUTPUT_PREVIEW_CHARS`). Over the limit, it builds a whole-line preview — roughly 70% head, 30% tail — with a settled marker line:

```
... N lines hidden (M of T chars) — full output: read_cell_output(cellIdx=K) ...
```

The marker's own width eats into the budget, so a fixed-point loop (up to 8 passes) settles the digit widths before the final cut; a configured limit so small that both sides cannot fit is trimmed at the inner edges. The untruncated output is never modified — it is persisted to the notebook and re-read by `read_cell_output`.

### Durable output and `read_cell_output`

Every executed cell is appended to the kernel's `.ipynb`, and the full (uncollapsed) output text is stored in the cell's `metadata.ptc_full_output` (`src/python-runtime/session.py`). `read_cell_output` (`src/index.ts`, `src/python-session-manager.ts`) reads the most recently used notebook-backed kernel, matches the 1-based `cellIdx` against the cell's `execution_count`, and prefers `metadata.ptc_full_output` over the stored stream/`execute_result`/error outputs. Slicing (`sliceCellOutput`) is 1-based like the native read tool:

- Defaults: 2,000 lines / 50 KB per call.
- Continuation hints: `[Showing lines X-Y of Z. Use offset=N to continue.]` — pass that `offset` to keep reading.
- A single line longer than 50 KB is truncated UTF-8-head-safe with a `[truncated]` notice.
- An `offset` past the end is an error, not an empty result.

### Cell boxes: preview, streaming, and completion

`exec_cell`, `scratch_run`, and `write_cell` each show a compact, bold tool-name
header in the theme's `toolTitle` color, styled like pi-tool-display. It appears
before arguments arrive and remains through streaming and completion, without
repeating the name above the Out box. Headers and label gutters leave wheel
scrolling to the transcript; only the fenced boxes capture it.

`src/execution/notebook-render.ts` uses the pure geometry in `src/execution/cell-view.ts` for every cell phase. Pi retains separate call and result components, so the argument preview yields at paint time as soon as a result owns the input box. Completion updates the pending `In[ ]:` to the runtime's actual execution count; notebook positions are never substituted for execution counts. Writes remain `In[ ]:` until executed, and scratch execution uses unnumbered `In:` / `Out:` labels.

The input and output fences align across one-, two-, and three-digit counts. Labels sit one column in from the transcript edge. The normal pending/success/error tool-call background covers every row across the full box width; ANSI resets in highlighted code or output restore that background. Counts beyond 999 grow the gutter safely rather than overflowing it.

- **Regular, collapsed:** seven body lines and a below-box `... N more lines >...` hint. The terminal owns transcript scrollback.
- **Fullscreen, collapsed:** eight body lines per box. Mouse-wheel events over a box scroll its own window; input and output positions are independent and survive redraws, streamed updates, and resizing. Wheel events remain inside the box, including at either window boundary and between redraws; they never simultaneously scroll the transcript.
- **Expanded (`ctrl+o`, or click a completed tool):** show the full cell, with no inner scrolling.

Streaming argument previews and live output follow their newest lines without an above-box hint. For blocks longer than seven lines, the gutter shows the total line count beneath `In[N]:` or `Out[N]:`, for example `(12 lines)`. This metadata does not add rows to the box. The line currently being written stays visible. Scrolling upward in fullscreen pauses tail-following; returning to the bottom resumes it. A capture-limit notice appears above the output when earlier streamed lines are no longer available.

### Syntax highlighting

`src/execution/code-highlight.ts` is shared by argument previews, streaming/finished input boxes, code reads/writes, and the approval popup. It selects GitHub Light or GitHub Dark from the main tool-pane background luma (using the active theme's resolved background color, including terminal defaults), with `PTC_CODE_THEME` as an explicit override. Cached highlights include the theme in their key, so light/dark changes do not reuse stale colors.

Highlighting runs asynchronously and requests a redraw when ready. Streaming requests are coalesced to at most one tokenization every 100 ms, with only one active job and the latest source queued; intermediate token snapshots are not highlighted. Visible historical cells retain their cached colors instead of being flushed whenever the streaming cache fills. While newer tokens wait for Shiki, the unchanged source prefix retains its last-known colors and only new or edited text uses plain ink. Older asynchronous results cannot replace a newer highlight snapshot, and theme changes never reuse the previous theme's colors. Geometry always comes from the raw source: the color update never changes row counts, truncation, or fence columns. A trailing newline does not discard retained colors when its empty highlight row is omitted from the visible box. A failed highlighter leaves readable plain code. The contrast guard retains dark ink on light backgrounds and replaces washed-out colors instead of replacing readable dark colors.

### Explicit cell review (`request_cell_review`)

Review is independent of execution. `request_cell_review` previews inline
`code`, a file's full contents (`file`), or the saved code cell at `n` in an
optional `session_id`. It shows a scrollable, syntax-highlighted viewport and
Approve / Reject / Reject-with-note choices. The result reports the decision;
no code runs, no cell is appended, and notebook outputs are not changed.

After approval, the model executes separately. Ordinary bug fixes within the
approved operation do not require another review; material scope changes do.
Escape rejects. Missing UI and dialog failures reject rather than running
unreviewed work. Execution tools have no `confirm` or `review` argument.

### Python error help hints

On a Python failure, `appendPythonErrorHelp` (`src/utils.ts`) appends at most one deterministic `help:` line to the traceback: `ModuleNotFoundError`/`ImportError` → `provision_dependency('<distribution>')`; `NameError` → define it / `inspect_kernel` (kernel may have restarted); `SyntaxError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `AttributeError` each get a fixed hint. If the traceback already contains a `help:` line, nothing is added.

## Usage

A typical round trip with a large result:

```python
# model calls exec_cell (cell 3 of the kernel):
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("events.csv")
print(df.describe())
df.groupby("region").sum()   # last bare expression echoes as Out[3]
```

The model receives (abridged):

```
output:
  <describe() output, or the head/tail preview if it exceeds 12,000 chars>
  ... 812 lines hidden (34,551 of 41,203 chars) — full output: read_cell_output(cellIdx=3) ...

return (Out[3]):
  region    amount    count
  ...

kernel:
  imports: pandas; vars: df (DataFrame); cells: 3
```

To page through the full durable output:

```json
{ "tool": "read_cell_output",
  "params": { "cellIdx": 3, "offset": 1, "limit": 2000 } }
```

```
<first 2,000 lines>

[Showing lines 1-2000 of 2812. Use offset=2001 to continue.]
```

Before a destructive operation, the model calls `request_cell_review`. The user can approve, reject, or reject with feedback. Only a later execution call runs the approved operation; ordinary repairs within approved scope do not prompt again.

## Options / configuration

| Env var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PTC_OUTPUT_PREVIEW_CHARS` | `12000` | Max chars of the model-visible exec result before head/tail collapsing. `PTC_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` is accepted as a legacy alias. |
| `PTC_MAX_SPOOL_CHARS` | `10000000` | Emergency per-cell capture ceiling against runaway memory; only output beyond this unusually large guard is discarded. Not a normal preview limit. |
| `PTC_CODE_THEME` | automatic GitHub Light/Dark | Override the shared cell/approval Shiki theme. Any supported Shiki theme name works; failed highlighting falls back to plain code. |
| `PTC_DEBUG` | off | Writes `[PTC]`-prefixed debug lines (including Shiki fallback reasons) to stdout. |

Label, border, diff, and error colors come from the active Pi theme. Code syntax colors come from the shared Shiki highlighter, chosen for the active tool-pane background.

## Standalone setup notes

- **Shiki is bundled, but highlight failure is silent.** `shiki` is a regular dependency of the package, so the approval popup works out of the box. Under the extension's jiti-based TypeScript loader the ESM import is shimmed specially; if highlighting ever fails you get plain text and, with `PTC_DEBUG=1`, a `[PTC] shiki unavailable...` line. No action needed.
- **`PTC_CODE_THEME` must be a valid Shiki theme name** (e.g. `github-dark`, `github-light`, `one-dark-pro`). An invalid name logs a debug message and falls back to plain text; it does not crash the popup.
- **Subagent panel and shimmer are self-contained.** The `subagents:` section, the workflow rollup, the footer status, and the shimmer animation only appear when the cell actually spawned `pi_subagents` pools. Panel rendering remains owned by pi-pycells. The bundled pi-activity extension supplies the stable activity API, not a replacement renderer. Activity snapshots are queried through pi-sock; activity assignment policy belongs to pi-activity.
- **Cell numbering includes sourced prefix cells.** If a kernel was provisioned with a `source` notebook, prefix cells (including markdown) count toward numbering — with 7 source cells, the first new cell is 8. `read_cell_output` matches the `execution_count` shown in `Out[n]` and previews, so use those numbers, not the position in the file.
- **The full output lives in the notebook file.** `read_cell_output` reads the `.ipynb` bound to the most recently used kernel. If you moved or deleted the notebook mid-session, paging fails with a `could not read notebook ...` error; keep the file in place until the session ends.
